# VirusTotal-IOC-Analyzer
This Python script analyzes IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as **IP addresses**, **domains**, and **file hashes** by querying the [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) API. It classifies each IOC based on the communityâ€™s vote and exports the results to a structured CSV.
